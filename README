De-duplication using lazy approach with variable size blocks

Required packages
-----------------
The following two packages has to be installed for the working for SHA1
	- libgcrypt11-dev 
	- libgpg-error
For a Ubuntu 64bit the following comands will install these packages
$ sudo apt-get install libgcrypt11-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libgpg-error-1.10

Project compilation
-------------------

A Makefile is provided and just running that file will compile the entire project

$ make clean
$ make

Project execution
-----------------


Project contents in the zip file
--------------------------------

Makefile      – Creates /tmp/dedupe_file_store, /tmp/dedupe_metadata, /tmp/dedupe_hashes and /tmp/dedupe_fs. 
                /tmp/dedupe_fs is the FUSE mount point exposed to the user as the dedupe-capable file system. 

dedupe_fs.c   – Main part of the program containing the simple FUSE based file system. 
                It also creates a new thread responsible for lazily working on the files stored in the initial file store. 
lazy_worker.c – Contains the lazy worker thread whose functionality has already been explained above.
rabin-karp.c  – Contains the implementation specific to Rabin-Karp fingerprinting algorithm.
sha1.c        – Contains the SHA1 implementation.
rabin-karp.h  - Header file which contains the function definitions required for Rabin-Karp fingerprinting algorithm
sha1.h        - Header file which contains the function defintions required for sha1 implementation
dedupe_fs.h   - Header file which contains the function definitions required for simple FUSE based file system
README        - Contains details about file contents, instructions about compliation and execution.
